Greetings! my name is Jackson Houser, a dedicated student learning about the dynamic world of Information Technology with a concentration focus on cybersecurity. Currently juggling the exciting challenges of academia and a full-time job, I find immense satisfaction in the convergence of theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience.

My journey into the realm of IT began with a curiosity about the digital landscape and a passion for securing it. As a student pursuing a concentration in cybersecurity, I'm constantly immersed in the ever-evolving landscape of digital security. From dissecting the intricacies of ethical hacking to exploring the ethical dimensions of technology, my academic pursuits aim to bridge the gap between theory and real-world application.

Beyond the classroom and office, I've decided to carve out a virtual space where I can share my thoughts, insights, and discoveries. Welcome to my public blog, where I delve into the ethical considerations of IT. Here, you'll find a blend of personal experiences, industry insights, and reflections on the ethical dilemmas that often accompany the rapidly advancing world of technology.

I invite you to join me on this journey of exploration, learning, and ethical contemplation. Let's navigate the digital frontier together, one ethical dilemma at a time.
